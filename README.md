# TweetContract

TweetContract is a Solidity smart contract that allows users to create and manage tweets and messages. It provides functionality for tweeting, sending messages, following other users, and managing access control through operators.

## Contract Structure

The contract is structured as follows:

### Structs

- **Tweet**: Represents a tweet with an ID, author address, content, and creation timestamp.
- **Message**: Represents a message with an ID, content, sender address, receiver address, and creation timestamp.

### Storage

The contract utilizes several mappings to store data:

- **tweets**: Maps tweet IDs to Tweet struct objects.
- **tweetsOf**: Maps user addresses to an array of tweet IDs, representing the tweets of each user.
- **conversations**: Maps user addresses to an array of Message struct objects, representing the messages sent by each user.
- **operators**: Maps user addresses to another mapping of operator addresses, indicating whether an operator has access to the user's functions.
- **following**: Maps user addresses to an array of addresses they are following.

### Functions

The contract provides the following functions:

- **tweet**: Creates a new tweet with the given content. Can be called by the contract owner or authorized operators.
- **sendMessage**: Sends a message to another user with the given content. Can be called by the contract owner or authorized operators.
- **follow**: Allows a user to follow another user.
- **allow**: Grants operator access to the caller.
- **disallow**: Revokes operator access from the caller.
- **getLatestTweets**: Retrieves the latest specified number of tweets from all users.
- **getLatestofUser**: Retrieves the latest specified number of tweets from a specific user.

## Usage

1. Deploy the TweetContract smart contract to an Ethereum-compatible blockchain.
2. Call the `tweet` function to create a new tweet.
3. Call the `sendMessage` function to send a message to another user.
4. Use the `follow` function to start following another user.
5. Grant or revoke operator access using the `allow` and `disallow` functions.
6. Retrieve the latest tweets using the `getLatestTweets` function.
7. Retrieve the latest tweets of a specific user using the `getLatestofUser` function.

## Access Control

The contract implements a basic access control mechanism using operators. The contract owner and authorized operators can perform tweet and message operations on behalf of other users. Operators can be added using the `allow` function and removed using the `disallow` function.
